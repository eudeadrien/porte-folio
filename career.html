        <h3>Internship </h3>
        <p>
          As part of my training DUT Réseaux et Télecommunications, I did a second-year internship. An internship at
          PC-Partners, a company that installs a personal count sensor. These sensors count the number of entrances
          and exits from a door, room or crossing point. 
          <br>
          I was a Level 1 and 2 Support Technician, that means, I received customer calls that were experiencing problems
          with their counting solution and did everything possible to alleviate the customer’s problem(s). And it could
          sometimes go through an on-site intervention but most often it remains a remote manipulation.

          reflection, it was not exactly what I wanted to do.
